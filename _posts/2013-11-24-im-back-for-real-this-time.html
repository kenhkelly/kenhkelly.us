<p>Hey everybody. I&#8217;m going to work hard on getting back into the mix of things. Over the past few months, I&#8217;ve been crazy busy. Because of this, I have quite a bit to talk about:</p>

<ul><li>I&#8217;ve done some traveling recently. First I went to Mountain View to visit Google for the Google Engage All-Stars Summit.</li>
<li>I also went to New York for the <abbr title="Search Marketing Expo">SMX</abbr> East 2013 to learn the latest in SEO, PPC, web design &amp; development, including mobile best practices, and social tactics.</li>
<li>At work, I&#8217;ve been inundated with tasks of rewriting websites, in which I&#8217;ve picked up some more handy code tricks and snippets, learned responsive, and even in two of my projects, began using Bootstrap and Markdown. </li>
<li>Plus a bunch more!</li>
</ul><p>To celebrate my return, I&#8217;ve updated this blog to a nicer, yet still simple template, and tweaked it out. You&#8217;ll also notice some more links that I put in place as shortcuts to the more commonly discussed topics (tags) here.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also some more topics and ideas in mind that I want to expand into for you gamers out there - but you&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>I know this is a teaser post, but you&#8217;re just going to have to stay tuned and see what good stuff I have in store for you guys.</p>

<p>Until next time - Cheers!<br />
Ken</p>
