<p>I was working on a new project when I had come up with a certain scenario. What I needed to do was refresh a piece of the webpage after an action was taken. Using jQuery, it&rsquo;s normally pretty straight forward, but it wasn&rsquo;t working as exactly the way I needed it.</p>

<p>Here is what you would normally use when you use AJAX to get a piece of a webpage.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-javascript">
$('.container').load('page.html .container');
  </code>
</pre>
<p>This works great in most instances, but because I was using Bootstrap, and the container I needed was also using the grid system, it became all wonky. What I discovered is that you can go deeper with your selectors. This is what I changed it too.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-javascript">
$('.container').load('page.html .container &gt; *');
  </code>
</pre>
<p>With this new snippet, I can load all on my content without doubling up the .container. You can see a side-by-side comparison on <a href="http://codepen.io/kenhkelly/pen/WbKKXM" target="_blank">CodePen</a>. Who really wants container inception, anyways.</p>

<p>I actually took it a step further and made a little function of it that you could easily add into your project.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-javascript">
function refreshPagePiece( url, container, callback ) {
 $(container).load( url +' '+ container +' &gt; *', function() {
    if ( callback )
       callback();
 } );
}
  </code>
</pre>
<p>This is a quick and simple way to grab a fresh piece of content from your website without reloading the whole page.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>
