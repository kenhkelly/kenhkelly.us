<p>With the latest in Google privacy conundrum, I&#8217;ve decided to make the switch from using Gmail as my personal email provider go using iCloud. There were a few things I&#8217;ve taken into consideration when it came to making this decision.</p>
<p>1. I was getting lots of spam and needed a new email address anyways.<br />
2. iCloud was already there and set up<br>
3. It integrates lovely with my Apple devices. <br>
4. I didn&#8217;t want yet another Google+ profile.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using iCloud for a few weeks now and have moved most of my services over to that email address and so far I don&#8217;t feel I&#8217;m missing anything. With iCloud I have my email, contacts, calendar, and notes sync, are all things I had with Gmail. Moving was very easy for those that are interested.</p>

<p>First, you can use your email client of choice to move your emails over, if you so desire (I didn&#8217;t). If you configure both clients with each email address using IMAP, you should be able to just drag and drop what you want to save.</p>

<p>For contacts, I used the native contacts app on my Mac. Both accounts were set up and I simply did a drag and drop from Gmail to iCloud, and done. Calendars and notes were the same process. You should be able to do in you client of choice.</p>

<p>In the end I&#8217;m pleased with my new set up. I created a Google account using my new email so I can use its services like YouTube for some video creation I&#8217;d like to get into, so I&#8217;m not completely rid of Google, which I&#8217;m fine with.</p>

<p>You know the old adage: don&#8217;t keep your eggs in one basket.</p>
