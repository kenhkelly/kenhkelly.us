<p>Just a little update. I've switched server hosting from NameCheap shared to a self managed Digital Ocean droplet. I did this because of the recent issues I've been having with NameCheap's reliability for whatever reasons.</p>

<p>I was able to put my server hosting skills to the test to roll my own solution. The solutions is now a full LAMP stack running on Centos 7. There were some quirks along the way to get it going, and I'm going to be sure to share those in future blog posts to help out those who might experience the same.</p>

<p>Be sure to subscribe to stay posted with updates if you aren't already.</p>

<p>Cheers to you, and cheers to reliability!<br>
