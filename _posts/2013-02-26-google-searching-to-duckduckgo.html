<p>It&rsquo;s curious how while I had this post on my list of things to write about that DuckDuckGo posted the funny, and in my opinion, critical comic (reblogged by me <a href="http://kenkell.com/post/44024433426/duckduckgo-from-the-joy-of-tech-ep-31-the" target="_blank">here</a>). Google is getting bigger and smarter than I&rsquo;m sure they even imagined possible. With tens of millions of searches performed daily, Google is learning more and more about you: your likes, dislikes, habits both good and bad, and even your dirty little secrets. All of this can be accomplished without you even having a Google account with the power of cookies stored on your computer. Much of this was the contributing factor of my switching from Google Search to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> (DDG).</p>
<p>I was an avid user of Google for searching for years, so I have pretty high standards for wanting my answers quickly. I tried Bing for a short time. While it was acceptable, it didn&rsquo;t quite do it for me. Then I read about DDG from a tweet about it&rsquo;s growth in share after a privacy scare Google had. I gave it a whirl, and to my surprise, my question was answered immediately. I like DDG for several reasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, <span><strong>Privacy</strong></span>.. capital P, bold, and underline. Some people don&rsquo;t care, but I do, and so should you. DDG does not <a href="http://donttrack.us/" target="_blank">track you</a>, nor do they &lsquo;<a href="http://dontbubble.us/" target="_blank">bubble you</a>,&rsquo; meaning they don&rsquo;t give you personalized results based on your searching history, and they don&rsquo;t store your information or send it to the websites that you navigate to from it.</p>
<p>Second thing I love about it is the quality results. If you do a search on DDG for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nucleus" target="_blank">nucleus</a>, you are given your results like you would expect. It also provides an information box telling you what it can find about your search. Because of this, many times I don&rsquo;t have to go to a website. In the case of &lsquo;nucleus&rsquo;, the first thing it provides is similar keywords with their definitions. You can then click through for more information.</p>
<p>Another bonus are the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/goodies" target="_blank">goodies</a> they offer. It has tools and knowledge for gaming, cooking, entertainment, finance, math, music, programming, science, social, travel, trivia, and more. Need to figure out the tip of a bill? Simple: <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=20%25+tip+on+%2421.63" target="_blank">20% tip on $21.63</a>. Live in Philly and want to know how far it is from London? <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=distance+philly+to+london" target="_blank">5710 km</a>. Hate notepad and want something different? <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=alternative+to+notepad" target="_blank">DDG&rsquo;s got you</a> (sidebar, I recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>). Head on over to the goodies page and check it out, pretty great stuff.</p>
<p>Last thing to note: the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html" target="_blank">!Bang commands</a>. These allow you to search your favorite sites quickly, straight from DDG. For example, if you don&rsquo;t like the result set of DDG for your search, throw a&#160;!g in front of the query and it&rsquo;ll direct you to a Google search for that phrase. You can search amazon (!amazon), programming languages (eg&#160;!php and&#160;!scala), frameworks (!ios), and oodles more.</p>
<p>Now you know why <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> is my default home page and my default search box in <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop" target="_blank">Firefox</a> on my desktop and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mercury-browser-fast-web-browser/id331012646?mt=8" target="_blank">Mercury</a> on my iOS devices.</p>
<p>I challenge you to give it a shot for a week and tell me about your experiences.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
