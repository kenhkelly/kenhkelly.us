<p>Hey there. I&#8217;m Ken. Welcome to my blog. A little about me. I&#8217;ve been a professional website developer for many years. I have a deep interest in anything technology and want to expand my horizons outside of just website development. I plan on using this space to share my experiences with experiments both inside and outside of my comfort zone. Some topics you&#8217;ll find on this blog include:</p>
<ul><li>Javascript</li>
<li>CSS2 / 3</li>
<li>HTML4 / 5</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>SEO</li>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>Servers</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Mac OS</li>
<li>Subversion systems</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>and whatever else tickles my fancy.</li>
</ul><p>I chose this platform over creating my own because I would prefer to focus on my experiments rather than writing a new website. I chose tumblr because of the community and sharing capabilities. So feel free to read my blog and repost things of interest to share with your followers.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />Ken</p>
