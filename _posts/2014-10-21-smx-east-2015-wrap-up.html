<p>BLOG - SMX East Wrap Up</p>

<p>It has been a few weeks since <a href="http://searchmarketingexpo.com/east/" target="_blank">SMX East 2014 in NYC</a>. I&rsquo;m still digesting all of the great stuff that I&rsquo;ve learned. It&rsquo;s a little delayed, but I wanted to share the rest of my takeaways from days two and three with you all. So here we go!</p>

<ul><li>Schema can be used for practically anything.</li>
<li>99% of SEOs still do SEO in a tactical manner (1 keyword + variations). SEO today is <em>strategic</em> &ndash; One researched topic for a landing page.</li>
<li>Make your content more holistic. </li>
<li>You cannot trick Google into ranking you just because you have your keywords in your headings and titles. You need content that backs that up (e.g. having a page about 15 tips of something, only without listing any tips &ndash; no good).</li>
<li>Search Engine Optimization is about Search Experience Optimization.</li>
<li>Schema has been updated to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD" target="_blank">JSON-LD</a> allowing you to mark up a page without doing it inline.</li>
<li>Some email clients can support schema to offer a convenient experience for users (e.g. Gmail cards)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t underestimate how powerful on-page optimization can be for local and local-organic results.</li>
<li>On-page optimization still matters.</li>
<li>Keep experimenting.</li>
<li>You need a strong and fast mobile experience, or you will be left behind.</li>
<li>If you have a business you want people to visit, have a Places page.</li>
<li>When filling out a local listing, don&rsquo;t skip the website. It&rsquo;s a local link to a local website.</li>
<li>Google understands more than we think they do.</li>
<li>SEO accounts for 20% of leads in a business&rsquo;s first year.</li>
<li>Keywords can be ambiguous (e.g. subway the sandwich maker or subway the transportation system?).</li>
<li>Google has moved from <em>strings</em> to <em>things</em>.</li>
<li>Consistency is community; inconsistency is phony.</li>
<li>Utilize the resources you have for creating content.</li>
<li>You can learn a ton by watching a customer review your product.</li>
<li>Go after the customers of tomorrow, not the past (so much).</li>
</ul><p>Overall, the conference was excellent. I cannot wait to go back for my fourth year next October. If you attended and would like to share some of your takeaways, please do in the comments section.</p>

<p>Until next time &ndash; Take care</p>
