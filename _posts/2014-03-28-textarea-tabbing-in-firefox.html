<p>Hey all. Just a quick tip I discovered when playing out with <a href="http://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>.</p>

<p>In a textarea of Firefox, typically when you hit tab, it moves to the next element. After mashing a few key combos, I discovered that you can put a tab character in the text box with <em>Option Shift Tab</em> on Mac. I haven&#8217;t tested this in Windows, or other browsers though. Let me know if it&#8217;s the same equivalent.</p>

<p>I have lots of ideas written down for future posts and will try to make some time to share my ramblings.</p>

<p>For now, cheers</p>
