<p>A while back, I needed to check the uptime of my Mac. To my delight, there are two simple commands in the terminal: <strong>uptime</strong> and <strong>w</strong></p>

<p>Uptime will return simply the uptime of the system.</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">
kenneths-mbp:~ kenneth$ uptime
 9:50  up 34 days, 14:17, 2 users, load averages: 1.50 2.38 4.74
  </code>
</pre>

<p>It will return the system uptime and the logged in users. If you see two users like I did, that&#8217;s because you are logged in twice: once in the desktop and once in the terminal.</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">
kenneths-mbp:~ kenneth$ w
 9:50  up 34 days, 14:18, 2 users, load averages: 1.49 2.28 4.60
USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT
kenneth  console  -                03Mar14 34days -
kenneth  s000     -                Sat10       - w   
  </code>
</pre>

<p>That&#8217;s my tip for the day.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
