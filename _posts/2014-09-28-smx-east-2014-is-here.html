<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again &mdash; <a href="http://searchmarketingexpo.com/east/" target="_blank">SMX East 2014</a> is here! Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be embarking back to New York City to join hundreds of other search marketers for my third year straight to learn the latest in our fields.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://searchmarketingexpo.com/east/agenda" target="_blank">agenda</a> is pretty exciting this year (as it has in always been) with lots to learn from all of Google&rsquo;s latest changes (both organically and paid) to the latest on the social media front. This only scratches the surface.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for some interesting tidbits I&rsquo;ll <a href="https://twitter.com/kenhkelly" target="_blank">surely share</a>. And if you&rsquo;re going to be in the NYC area, be sure to connect with me either at the <a href="http://searchmarketingexpo.com/east/" target="_blank">conference</a> or outside.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
