<p>I don&#8217;t know if you guys have used it, or even have heard about it, but it&#8217;s something definitely worth considering. I&#8217;ve been using it for quite some time now and it really does make your life with CSS easier. You can read up on it <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">here</a> and download it.</p>

<p>It has a full set of features, but here are the ones I use pretty consistently:</p>

<ul><li>Variables: great for helping maintain the color scheme without remember the hex codes for everything.</li>
<li>Mixins: great for using repetitious code. For example, border-radius and each browser extension of it (-moz, -webkit, -o, -ms).</li>
<li><strong>Nesting</strong> (bolded for emphasis): just nest everything like you are used to in other languages.</li>
</ul><p>Because LESS is a javascript library to do this stuff, the page might load before the styles are fully rendered. To help avoid this, and to keep your css in a manner that does not require javascript, you have the option to use <a href="http://leafo.net/lessphp/" target="_blank">lessphp</a>. This will compile the code and deliver the css file and I&#8217;ve never had an issue of the page loading before the styles were done. I also prefer to compress the file so it&#8217;s much less load on the server and user.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a code snippet of how I use lessphp. Put this in a file called styles.php (for example):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
if(extension_loaded('zlib')) ob_start('ob_gzhandler');
header("Content-type: text/css");
include "css/lessc.inc.php";
$less = new lessc;
echo $less-&amp;gt;compileFile("css/styles.less");
if(extension_loaded('zlib')) ob_end_flush();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However you chose to use it, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll make your life easier.</p>

<p>Happy Styling</p>
