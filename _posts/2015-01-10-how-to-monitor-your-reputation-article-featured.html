<p>I was recently featured in the <a href="http://www.floridassa.org/form/Inprint_1214.pdf" target="_blank">Florida Self Storage Association InPrint publication</a> for an article I wrote. It is titled &ldquo;How To Monitor Your Reputation.&rdquo; To summarize, it is about using Google Alerts to keep on top of your online reputation by setting up the alerts to look for your website domain and your business&rsquo; name. You can also use it to check when someone is talking about a specific article you wrote or if they linked to your website.</p>

<p>Give the full article a read over at the <a href="http://www.floridassa.org/form/Inprint_1214.pdf" target="_blank">FSSA InPrint (Dec 2014) issue</a>, on page 12.</p>
