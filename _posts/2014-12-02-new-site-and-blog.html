<p>Hey everyone! I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving and that all the left-over turkey made awesome sandwiches. Over the holiday break, I found some time to revamp and up-do my website. This included a huge face lift, portfolio update, about/resume update, and a contact page addition.</p>

<p>Ken&rsquo;s Ramblings was also given a face-lift and carried over from the Tumblr platform. While in the past I wasn&rsquo;t a Wordpress fan, I decided to give it another shot. I created this template from scratch to meet all of my needs. No extra plugin fluff here. It turns out that it&rsquo;s not a bad system once you get used to the quirks.</p>

<p>Overall this face-lift is a revitalization to the blog and my sharing of tips and thoughts on all things web and technology.</p>

<p>Be sure to stay tuned, and sign up for the mailing list below to be the first to receive updates.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
Ken</p>
