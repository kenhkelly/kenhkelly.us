<p>It was a great day today at <a href="http://searchmarketingexpo.com/east/" target="_blank">SMX East 2014</a> in New York City. I&#8217;ve met some cool people, learned some new things, and refreshed on others. Some key sharable takeaways that I picked up from the sessions I attended are:</p>

<ul><li>SEO is not a project</li>
<li>Check your website log files to see how Google actually accesses your site</li>
<li>Social is the authentic face of a brand</li>
<li>IF social is discovery, THEN search is validation</li>
<li>When researching your competitors, there is no &#8220;magic metric&#8221; to base off of. It depends who your online competitors are and your market.</li>
<li>Pull data, record, watch!</li>
<li>Today&#8217;s grey hat is tomorrow&#8217;s black hat. Today&#8217;s white hat is tomorrow&#8217;s grey hay</li>
<li>Twitter cards and Facebook Open Graph is some pretty powerful stuff if implemented correctly</li>
<li>"Go ahead and do it!"</li>
</ul><p>There&#8217;s some food for thought for the night before becoming crammed with more gems tomorrow.</p>

<p>If you are at the conference and have a little down time tomorrow, <a href="https://twitter.com/kenhkelly" target="_blank">tweet me (@kenhkelly)</a> and let&#8217;s meet up and talk some shop.</p>
