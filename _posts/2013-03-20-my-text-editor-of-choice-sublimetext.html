<p>Several months ago we hired a new employee and he shared with me a text editor alternative, called <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">SublimeText</a>. It&#8217;s fantastic. It&#8217;s a cross between basic text editor to programming IDE (but without the complexities that come with your typical IDE). It&#8217;s also very customizable and uses JSON files to maintain your settings, keyboard shortcuts, etc. Definitely worth checking out if you are needing something a little more that your current editor may not offer.</p>
<p>Also check out the plugin <a href="http://emmet.io/" target="_blank">Emmet</a>. It&#8217;s a text expander for HTML and CSS (probably does much more too, but that&#8217;s what I use it for). It&#8217;s great for quickly creating the boilerplate HTML for your newest web project.</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>
