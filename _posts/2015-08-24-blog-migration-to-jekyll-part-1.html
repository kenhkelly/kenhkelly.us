<p>Hello everyone. During my down time over the past few <s>weeks</s><ins>months</ins>, I have been slowly migrating the blog over to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a static website platform. One of my major reasons for doing this was I didn't have the time for constant Wordpress upkeep. The other major reason was because I started to learn Ruby, and I wanted to attempt to put it to use.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a very cool utility. You create simple html or markdown based files and blog posts, and it does the rest for you, creating a nice and easy to upload statically generated website. It uses <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers" target="_blank">Liquid</a> to generate the HTML files.</p>

<p>I find that the website is much easier to manage and I'm even using it with Git and hooks for deployment.</p>

<p>It's very simple to get started. There are a few prerequisites that need to be installed first (if not already): Ruby, RubyGems, and a Javascript runtime like NodeJS. From their <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/" target="_blank">quick-start guide</a>, to get simply started: </p>

<pre>
~ $ gem install jekyll
~ $ jekyll new myblog
~ $ cd myblog
~/myblog $ jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
</pre>

<p>You can also start a new blog in the current directory with <code>jekyll new .</code>.</p>

<p>You are now ready to get in there and start tinkering with your new static website. Go on and check out <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/kenhkelly/kenhkelly.us" target="_blank">repo</a> and stay tuned for at least two more parts going over plugins, oddities, and tips I experienced during my site mirgation and launch.</p>

<p>Until next time, <br>Ken</p>
