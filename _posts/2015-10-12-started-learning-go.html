<p>At work, we use Go for our backend API. I started to learn it to be able to help fixes and enhancements to the API. So far I think it's great. It's relatively easy to pick up but has a few interesting syntaxes and ways of doing things (coming from a PHP developer standpoint).</p>

<p>I started to learn it using <a href="https://gobyexample.com" target="_blank">Go by example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kenhkelly/Go-By-Example" target="_blank">following along their examples</a>. After I got the hang of it, I started to make my own little CLI programs: <a href="https://github.com/kenhkelly/GoWeather" target="_blank">GoWeather</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kenhkelly/GoCurrency" target="_blank">GoCurrency</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a log of fun, and more fun to come with some other ideas I have. Check Go out, it might be useful to you.</p>
