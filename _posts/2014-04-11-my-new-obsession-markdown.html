<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been really getting into <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great because it makes life so much easier when it comes to writing your content without worrying about formatting. I use it for my blog posts and it has greatly sped things up and kept everything in a similar format.
There are a few tools out there that I&rsquo;ve been using as well.</p>

<ul><li>An extension I added to Firefox is called <a href="http://markdown-here.com/" target="_blank">Markdown Here</a>. Markdown Here will help you to write email more quickly and powerfully than you thought possible. </li>
<li>Tumblr supports Markdown, using a variation that has a few more features than the traditional Markdown - Called <a href="http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/" target="_blank">PHP Markdown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://draftin.com/" target="_blank">Draft</a> also supports Markdown.</li>
</ul><p>I strongly encourage you to read more about it and see how it&rsquo;ll fit in to your flow.</p>
