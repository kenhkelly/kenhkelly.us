<p>The other day, I chose to jailbreak my phone. This is the first time in years since the majority of the features I wanted have been adopted into iOS (notifications, copy/paste, etc.).</p>
<p>My decision to jailbreak my phone again was for a few things I definitely prefer to have. But more on that later.</p>
<p>To jailbreak, you need the untethered jailbreak called evasi0n (just Google it). It&#8217;s pretty interesting because you can jailbreak using Mac OS, Windows, or even Linux. I have only tested Windows. I updated my phone to iOS 6.1.1 and then ran the jailbreak. Quite a smooth process.</p>
<p>I immediately added my must haves, which can be all found in Cydia.</p>
<ul><li>SBSettings (toggles in your notification center)</li>
<li>f.lux (changes the screens colors to be easier on the eyes at night time. Read more <a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
<li>Browser Changer (Changes your default web browser. Side note: I enjoy <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mercury-web-browser-fast-fullscreen/id331012646" target="_blank">Mercury</a>)</li>
<li>OpenSSH</li>
<li>Mobile Terminal</li>
</ul><p>There&#8217;s lots more you can add to the phone too that I won&#8217;t get into. I recommend the jailbreak because you can now do it untethered while having the latest iOS version, so it&#8217;s an added bonus even if you just add a few things like I did.</p>
<p>If you jailbroke your phone for something you feel I would enjoy, please let me know.</p>
<p>Happy Jailbreaking!</p>
