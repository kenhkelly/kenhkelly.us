At my day-job, one of my main priorities is working on our back end API, which is done in [Go](http://kenhkelly.us/2015/10/started-learning-go/). I have tried a few of the text editors that some recommend using to program Go, but they haven't worked quite well for me. Naturally, I stuck with SublimeText as it has been my favorite editor for years.

[GoSublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime) is a great plugin to use with SublimeText for your Go needs. Some of the powerful features include: 

- Code completion
- Linting and syntax checking
- Listing function declaration
- Integrated building
- Automatic go fmt.
- *[much more..](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime)*

Try it out and let me know how it works.

Enjoy!
