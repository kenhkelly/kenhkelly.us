<p>Hey all. I&#8217;d like to apologize for my disappearing act. Been pretty swamped with business and such, but I&#8217;m going to make more of an effort to get back into this.</p>
<p>For my return back, here is a nice little Google Drive tip that I found on <a href="http://www.funbutlearn.com/2013/02/direct-download-link-to-your-google.html" target="_blank">funbutlearn.com</a>. You can use Google Drive to host and download files directly. You do that by plugging the file&#8217;s unique key into a direct download link.</p>
<p>You can find your key when you open the file in the default view:</p>
<pre>https<span></span>://docs.google.com/file/d/<strong>&lt;KEY&gt;</strong>/edit</pre>
<p>Then you can take that key and plug it into this url:</p>
<pre>http<span></span>://drive.google.com/uc?id=<strong>&lt;KEY&gt;</strong>&amp;e=download</pre>
<p>Voila! You can also hotlink images from Google Drive into your site.</p>
<p>Take care!</p>
