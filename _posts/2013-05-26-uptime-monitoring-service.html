<p>It has been quite a while since I&#8217;ve last posted something. Things have gotten pretty hectic and I haven&#8217;t had time to do to much playing or writing. I&#8217;ve some things in the works to share with you all.</p>
<p>Today I wanted to share a server uptime monitoring service I started to use. I&#8217;ve needed one of these for a while, but everything I found was paid. And then I found it - <a href="http://uptimerobot.com/" title="Uptime Robot" target="_blank">Uptime Robot</a>.</p>
<p>Uptime Robot a pretty good free service. It checks the server in 5 minutes increments. If the server is down, it doesn&#8217;t just send you the alert immediately, it checks again to make sure it&#8217;s really down so not throw a false positive. It supports 50 different sites (which is plenty if you only use a few servers). It checks websites via the HTTP Port, but you can also set it up to check specific ports - I have it check my hosted Minecraft Server.</p>
<p>They offer an API, which is pretty interesting. I haven&#8217;t used it yet but it looks pretty straight-forward. You can receive alerts by any combination of email, sms, Twitter, or push notifications for iOS.</p>
<p>If this is a service you&#8217;ve been needing for your clients or yourself, I highly recommend giving it a look.</p>
<p>Cheerio!</p>
